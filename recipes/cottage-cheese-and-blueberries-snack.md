### Tips
- This snack is great on days that you don't workout. It can be modified for workout days:
	- __As a pre-workout__: Remove flaxseed and add carbs. You can double berries or add half a banana, oats, etc.
	- __As a post-workout__: Keep the flaxseed and add carbs. If I'm eating this as a post-workout meal close to bed time, then I may add a little extra blueberries but not much.
- I feel that the sodium and saturated fat are pretty high given that this is just a snack. I may need a different snack choice that is extra low in sodium and saturated fat to compensate.
